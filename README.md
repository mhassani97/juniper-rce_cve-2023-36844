# Technical Analysis

watchTowr performed a deep dive into reproducing, chaining and exploiting these vulnerabilities which can be found at: https://labs.watchtowr.com/cve-2023-36844-and-friends-rce-in-juniper-firewalls/

# Summary

1. A pre-authentication upload vulnerability can be used to upload an arbitrary PHP file to a restricted directory with a randomised file name.
2. Using the same vulnerable function, we upload a PHP configuration file (.ini) which points to and loads the PHP file from step 1 using the `auto_prepend_file` directive.
3. As all environment variables can be set via HTTP requests, we overwrite the environment variable `PHPRC` to load the PHP configuration file from step 2 and trigger the execution of the PHP function declared in step 1.

# Usage

The PHP function can be specified using the flag `â€”payload`, however `php_uname()` is set by default.

`python watchtowr-vs-junos_juniper_2023-08-25.py --url http://localhost`

`python watchtowr-vs-junos_juniper_2023-08-25.py --url http://localhost --payload "get_current_user()"`

# Mitigations

Update to the latest version of JunOS, and/or apply the patches provided by Juniper. If these actions are not possible, please leverage the provided Juniper workaround.
